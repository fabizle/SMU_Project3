Welcome to SMU Project 3 - Creating an interactive dashboard about US Tornados!
 

Project Overview
Our team has diligently collaborated to delve into the Tornados 1950-2022 dataset from Kaggle.com. We chose this dataset because it has a wide breadth of data and our curiosity about categorizing tornados. We aimed to uncover US tornado patterns through exploratory data engineering, data analysis, and data visualization.

Our landing page consists of one dropdown by region.  The dashboard page displays a bar chart, box plot chart, sunburst chart, and map. Select filter for the dropdown and the bar, box plot, and sunburst charts, and the map will update.

Ethical considerations made in the project

Several ethical considerations were made to ensure the responsible use of data. First, our team ensured that all data sources used were obtained legally and with proper permissions. Additionally, we tried to minimize any potential bias that could arise from the data analysis. We carefully examined the data for any potential algorithmic bias and took steps to mitigate it. Overall, our team prioritized ethical considerations to ensure the responsible and ethical use of data throughout the project.
